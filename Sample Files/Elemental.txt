Elemental
The Elemental embodies a specific element and is in a constant struggle between their mortal and primordial natures. Often relating better to your element than humanity, you occasionally find yourself on the wrong end of a social interaction. Pick an element to control like Air, Earth, Fire, Water, or something else. You cannot be injured by an element you've mastered and can manipulate it in basic ways.
Tempest
You embody your element completely as your humanity fades to the background and you become capable of incredible feats. Become the flame, bend the wind to your will, part the waves, or shake the earth. You are the master of your domain.
