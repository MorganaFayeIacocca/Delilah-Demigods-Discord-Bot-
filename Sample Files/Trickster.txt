Trickster
In most cultures, Tricksters are teachers and guides. Whether your parent was someone like Coyote, Loki, or Arohirohi, you advise, hint, and cajole to bring these mortals enlightenment. Tricksters are not always funny gods, but you do see the world differently from most everybody else. You will do almost whatever it takes to achieve your goals. This is lucky when your friends want the same things you do, and awkward when they don't.
Bait and Switch
Why would you ever want to be the center of attention? Your Ascendance move lets you use someone else's Ascendance. You can either mimic it and control it yourself, or let someone else use theirs on your dime. Wouldn't it be a shame if the wrong person was blamed?

Even Now
While you are dead, your shade in the mortal world is deftly able to annoy people. Sometimes your actions might even be construed as helpful. Tie shoelaces together, swing the door the wrong way, catch a gun in its holster. You put the heist in poltergeist.

#OutfitOfTheDay
You're always dressed and styled the way you want to be. Your hair, makeup, and clothes morph to be perfect for the given occasion. Casual or formal is up to you. If you try to mimic a recognizable uniform or outfit, it will look mostly convincing, but aways be slightly off in some small detail. GIFTED: If you have Mimicry, you may use this ability to resemble a specific person and their outfit

Oh You Mean This Gate Key
You are able to produce a small object which is useful in the immediate situation, but is not 100% correct, and only works once. For example, a key which opens the door, but jams the lock, an ID badge that works if you don't look too closely, or a swipe card thatgoes blank after use. GIFTED: If you have a Puzzle Box, the object works perfectly the first time, no glitches. The object can be used two more times after that, but no promises on the result. Roll PERFORM UNDER PRESSURE when you use it again.

The Hard Way
When you present a course of action to your Weave, you don't need to roll SWAY SOMEONE. Each member can choose to take 1 Harm (ignoring armor) to receive +1 ongoing while pursuing your plan. That Harm can't be healed until you sleep, which also ends the +1 ongoing. SPINDLE: if you present your course of action at the Spindle, you can choose to take 2 Harm, ignoring armor, to provide the +1 ongoing. This is in place of the 1 Harm each member would take. It can't be healed until you sleep.
