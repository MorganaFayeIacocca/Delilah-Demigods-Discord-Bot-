Warrior
A Warrior is often many other things as well: a poet, a chef, a parent, or a teacher to name just a few. While always a last resort, in your heart of hearts you know that sometimes violence is the best solution, and you're the one prepared to carry it out. Your response will bne tactical, thoughtful, and crushingly victorious.
Grandmaster
Like a chess master, every aspect and strategy of the battlefield unfolds before you and you reveal the plan you had the whole time. You turn the tide of the battle and win the day. Describe how.

Polyarmory
Nearly anything is a deadly weapon in your hands. An oar, a playing card, a sturdy towel--you name it and its dangerous. The object you pick up won't last long for how you're using it, but it'll go out in a blaze of glory and you can grab something new. Deal 3 Harm with almost any physical object. GIFTED: If you have Epic Weapon (Melee for up close or Ranged for thrown objects) anything you pick up will deal 4 Harm
