Reaper
No one understands death and dying the way you do. A Reaper is not a killer though--your job starts after the killing is done. You're a guide for those who are ready to pass beyond this world. You've been consumed with thoughts of the dead for as long as you can remember, either as morbid fascination, or with a lust for life that fuels endless revelry. Whether they fear you or not, death comes for everyone in the end
Harbinger
You are become Death, immortal chooser of the slain. For this moment, you are impervious to Harm. Wade through the mayhem and raise fallen allies to live again. This party isn't over until you say it's over
