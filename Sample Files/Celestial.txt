Celestial
The Celestial is the huntress, the investigator, the one peeking behind the velvet curtains. Your destiny lies in the heavens. Whether that means the stars, the moon, the planets, or the sun, you make your rounds looking for anything out of place. Your view from on high also gives insights into the future and the true nature of the people around you. Secrets beware: The Celestial is watching.

The stars align as every strand spools out before you. Step calmly through the mayhem, predicting every twitch and gust of wind to set things back on the course you've determiend is correct. All this has happened before, and will happen again, but this time you're in control
