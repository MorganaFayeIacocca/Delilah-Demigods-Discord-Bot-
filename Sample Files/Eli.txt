Backstory
Backstory BeginText Mortal dad met immortal dad in 1998 at Glastonbury music festival during the Friday headliner like true music nerds and thus was born one Eli Griffiths. Since then, the family of two immigrated to the Glastonbury-less US of A where Eli finished his education and attended camp. He was decisively less sad than his dad about the dwindling population of music festivals on this land mass. Instead, Eli embraced the way he could get away with doing things he really shouldn't with the help of a little prestidigitation, a silver tongue, and a British accent. If only any one of those three could get rid of his stubborn bed hair and his obnoxious denial of all emotional connections.
