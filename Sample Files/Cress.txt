Roll 2 6 Prowess

Polyarmory
Nearly anything is a deadly weapon in your hands. An oar, a playing card, a sturdy towel--you name it and its dangerous. The object you pick up won't last long for how you're using it, but it'll go out in a blaze of glory and you can grab something new. Deal 3 Harm with almost any physical object. GIFTED: If you have Epic Weapon (Melee for up close or Ranged for thrown objects) anything you pick up will deal 4 Harm

You find Melissa's impulsiveness to be off-putting.
You have a friendly rivalry with Liz, always trying to one-up each other
You've never actually seen Kat fight. Can you trust them? What are they going to do, drink their way out of a fight?
